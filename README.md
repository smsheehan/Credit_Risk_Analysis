# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate a variety of machine learning models against a dataset of information on credit card loans to see if we can accurately predict non-performing loans (NPLs).  Since the number of good (or high performing) loans greatly outnumber the non-performing loans we will need to evaluate models designed for unbalanced datasets such as this.  Before starting we should ground ourselves in an understanding of the issue and how our models might be useful in practice.  The following information can be found on statista.com at:  https://www.statista.com/statistics/211047/percentage-of-non-performing-loans-held-by-us-banks/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%200.89%20percent%20of,aftermath%20of%20the%20Financial%20Crisis.

As can be seen in the above blurb, it is important for us to understand that banks will use interest rate to help manage the risk.  Understanding this helps put into perspective how our model might fit into the big picture.  


## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
